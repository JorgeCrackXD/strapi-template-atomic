## ‚öôÔ∏è Error managment

This template contains a global error handler in the file `bootstrap.js` in API folder and that handler allows to remove all try catch from controllers and services and all the error are gonna be processed and catched by that file. 
```
try {
  await next();
} catch (error) {
  await createErrorObject(ctx, error);
  throw error;
}
```
If a custom error or specific error can be thrown, you still have to use a try catch block in the service you are working.
```
try{
  //All the logic
} catch ( error ) {
  throw new ValidationError("Lorem Ipsum");
}
```
