## ‚öôÔ∏è Error managment

This template contains a global error handler in the file ``bootstrap.js` in API folder and that handler allows to remove all try catch from controllers and services ( If a custom error or specific error can be thrown, you still have to use a try catch block ) and all the error are gonna be processed and catched by that file.
